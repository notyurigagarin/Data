Simple SQL provisioning that works even with an FTP file from the sales website to the internal system

 - A small, online store that has 3 salespeople
 - They're planning to expand an hire more people, but not to change infraestructure
 - The payments are done via an external website, no credit card data is stored and the promotions are applied automatically in the final price. There is no need for a calculated column

Also, there were no data insertions as im currently a complete broke ass and my computer shuts down when SQL Server is running with Chrome + Excel, even more ith multiple Excel entities with data being created out of my imagination
